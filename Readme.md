# Hotel Churn Prediction or Booking prediction
This is a machile learning binary classification problem where you predict the hotel booked will be canceled or not. It is based on the of hotel in and around europe.


## 📚 Approach 
1. Cleaning of data is very important when dealing with realtime data
2. Many model for classification were tried and best were selected
3. Retraining pipeline was setup for the data.

## 🧑‍💻 How to setup
create fresh conda environment 
```python
conda create -p venv python=3.7 -y
```
activate conda environment
```python
conda activate venv/
```
Install requirements
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the web app
```python
python app.py
```

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Used
1. Machine Learning
2. Binary classification 
3. Random forest and XgBoost 
4. FastAPI

## 🏭 Industrial Use-cases 
1. We can predict the probable number of cancellation and allocate them to the new customer
2. It even helps in better resource management.

## 👋 Conclusion
It hepls to save the resources and also helps to gain more profit from the buisess based on the study.
